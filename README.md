# Pokemon Go Traveling Trainer App
# Motivations
I wanted to create this project because I wanted a tool to help me more easily get to the different Pokestops within Pokemon Go. Pokemon Go is a mobile augmented reality game where the world contains monsters, gyms and the aformentioned Pokestops. The objective of the game is to train and battle Pokemon. A key component of this game is to travel around and collect different items from point called "Pokestops". 

# App Design
